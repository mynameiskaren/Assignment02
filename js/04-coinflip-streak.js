//In this part of the assignment you will explore what you’ve learned so far about variables, do while loops, conditionals, operators, math, and more to create a “coin flip streak game”. The point of this simple game is to see what kind of streak you can get to (how many times “Heads” comes up in a row before “Tails” does to end the game). To complete the game follow the steps outlined below:

//1.	Begin your application by declaring a variable called coinFlip. Do not assign the variable a number just yet.
var coinFlip;

//2.	Create a do while loop.
//3.	Within the do while loop assign a randomly generated number to coinFlip. You will have to use a Math method to get this number. Also, make sure to round that number off so that you get either a 0 or 1 as the result.
do{
    coinFlip = Math.round(Math.random());
    
    
    //4.	Use a conditional to check the result of the coin flip. If it’s 0, write out “Heads” into the console window. If it’s 1, write out “Tails” into the console window. 
   
    if(coinFlip == 0)
        console.log("Heads\n");
    else
        console.log("Tails\n");
    
//5.	Set the condition of the do while loop to end once the coinFlip becomes “Tails”.
}while(coinFlip != 1);
